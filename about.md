                My name is Jessica. I am a visual designer at GoSwiff.

            <p>I graduated from Loughborough University with a major in Graphics Communication. Back in 2008, I took advertising courses at NAFA and started building <a href="https://www.behance.net/jessicateh">my portfolio.</a></p>
            <p>My want right now, is to rewind the time where I could have learnt <a href="https://design.tutsplus.com/">everything online</a> and saved a lot of money. I also believe that designers learn best by practising it and having a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ianlimwm?fref=ts">good mentorship</a> helps along the way.</p>
            <p> When I'm not designing, you can find me taking <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jsscateh/" target="_blank">random shots of my lovely ones</a>, running, swimming or playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbXEKZVonko">video-game.</a></p>
            <p>
              If you would like to hang out or talk about working together, you can
              contact me at <u>almostjessica[at]gmail.com</u>.
